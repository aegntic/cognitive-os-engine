# cognitive-os-engine

## What this is

`cognitive-os` is a 699-line *specification* — a cognitive architecture carried as prompt protocol by AI harnesses (Claude Code, Hermes, Codex, Gemini, Cursor). It defines a four-tier memory model (§3.1), a forgetting curve (§3.4), and a verification chain (§4.1). But a spec loaded into a context window stores nothing. This repo is the engine that turns §3 of the spec into running software.

**Status: M0 walking skeleton is runnable.** CLI `init` / `cycle` / `search` / `health` over a fixture vault, SQLite + FTS5 hybrid search, local ollama embeddings, cycle gates, cycles ledger. The design below is the committed roadmap; M0 is the first executable increment. Every claim on this page describes either what exists (M0 CLI + docs) or what is explicitly marked *planned*.

## Why this exists

The motivating incident is real and worth recording. A PGlite-backed brain (gbrain 0.18.2) grew to 7.1 GB, silently exceeded PGlite's in-memory WASM heap ceiling (~2–4 GB), and **every import failed for 2.5 months — 4,474 logged failures, zero successful imports, while the service reported "green" cycles** because unchanged-vault skip paths masked the dead database. Three failure classes, all structural:

1. **Ceiling** — an in-memory engine over a corpus that only grows is a time bomb.
2. **Silence** — a memory system whose writes fail quietly isn't a memory system.
3. **Opacity** — a derived index that must be treated as precious cargo inverts the source of truth.

The engine is designed against all three.

## Principles

1. **Vaults are canonical.** Markdown vaults (Obsidian or plain dirs) are the source of truth. The engine is a derived index that can be deleted and rebuilt from source at any time. `engine rebuild` is a first-class, boring operation.
2. **Disk-backed, no ceiling.** SQLite + [sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec). 64-bit addressing, memory-mapped reads, streaming writes. The corpus can outgrow any heap without the engine noticing.
3. **Loud by default.** Every cycle verifies its own work: imported-count vs discovered-count, embedded-count vs imported-count, export freshness. A failed gate fails the cycle, exits non-zero, and writes a JSONL health record. Silent no-op success is treated as a bug class of its own.
4. **Local-first.** Embeddings via local ollama (nomic-embed-text class) by default; zero API keys required for the core loop. Remote providers optional, pluggable.
5. **Four tiers, first-class.** Working (in-process), Episodic (events with timestamps and outcomes), Semantic (pages + entities + links), Procedural (skills with confidence). Not one flat table with a `type` column — separate access patterns, separate tables, one schema.
6. **Forgetting is a feature.** Every memory carries `confidence` decaying per spec §3.4 (`c = c0 · e^(−days/30)`); access reinforces. Below 0.3, memories archive — never delete (§8.2: "Never delete knowledge. Archive with timestamp and reason").
7. **Contradictions are kept, not resolved silently.** Newer wins for active decisions; both versions remain queryable with timestamps (§3.3).
8. **Cross-project isolation.** Instincts and indexes are scoped per project; no leakage between brains (§3.3).

## M0 — what you can run today

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/cos-engine --home /tmp/cos init --vaults fixtures/vault --embedder ollama:nomic-embed-text
./target/debug/cos-engine --home /tmp/cos cycle --json     # green: discovered == imported == embedded
./target/debug/cos-engine --home /tmp/cos search "silent failure" --json
./target/debug/cos-engine --home /tmp/cos health log
```

Verified 2026-08-27 against local ollama `nomic-embed-text`: first cycle 3/3/3 green; second cycle `skipped=3` (not a silent zero-import green); dead embedder URL fails at the **embed** gate, exit 1, ledger names the gate. Search returns `_meta.fused_from` from FTS5 + vector cosine.

Vectors live as BLOBs in SQLite (disk-backed, no WASM heap). sqlite-vec ANN is M1 if the corpus needs it — the ceiling that killed PGlite is already gone.

## Comparison (honest, as of the incident)

| Capability | gbrain 0.18 (incident) | gbrain 0.46 (current) | this engine (M0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Storage | PGlite, in-memory heap | PGlite or Supabase Postgres | SQLite + FTS5 + vector BLOBs (disk) |
| Silent-failure defense | none (the incident) | partial (doctor improvements) | cycle gates, hard-fail, JSONL health |
| Four tiers as schema | no | partial | yes (§3.1 direct mapping) |
| Forgetting curve | none | none | §3.4 decay + reinforcement |
| Vault-canonical rebuild | no | no | yes, first-class |
| Local embeddings | fork patch | native (ollama) | native, default |
| Harness integration | OpenClaw/Claude-centric | broad | Hermes MCP first |

gbrain is excellent software with an active maintainer — the engine exists to execute *this* spec's memory model faithfully, not to beat gbrain on features. Where gbrain is stronger, the table says so.
